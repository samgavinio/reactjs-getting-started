## Getting Started with Reactjs ##

Reactjs is a javascript view library built by Facebook and Instagram. So much has been told about it already, read about it [yourself](http://facebook.github.io/react/). 

This application is a very simple task manager to demonstrate how you can use react to build reusable UI components. All it really does is allow you to add new task
and delete existing ones, nothing fancy.
